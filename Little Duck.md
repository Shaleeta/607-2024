Found a text copy online of "The Tiger's Bride" and copied it into a doc. Formatted it and printed it so I can make notes, markup, etc. on it. Formatted it double space, 12 pt font with large paragraph breaks so it will be easy to read. Added page numbers so that I know at a glance if the pages are out of order.
Then, spent some time making the cover for the audiobook. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and since this isn't a design assignment, I'm not gonna worry about it anymore now that it's done.
I also bought these really cute headphones. They were only $40, and they aren't fantatic or anything. The reason I got them is because they have light up cat ears on them! I needed new headphones anyways, so this project gave me a good excuse to get these stupid things. I love them so much.

### Next Steps
Practice. Practice. Practice.
Keep a pencil in hand while I practice so that I can make notes on the script as I go.
Maybe find a second reader for different voices? I like the idea of having a male voice as well as a female one, but I'm not sure who I would ask. My dad might be into it. He's a good storyteller.
I'm hoping to start recording next week.

Ugggghhhh. I'm changing which story I'm going to read for my audiobook. I was going to do "The Tiger's Bride" but it's pretty long and I'd rather not do only part of it since it's already a short story. So, I'm going to look at "The Werewolf," also by Carter, or maybe I'll narrate one of my own short stories, which could be fun.

I've decided to do an audiobook version of one if my short stories since I think "The Werewolf" would be too short. Now I just need to decide which of my own stories I want to do.
