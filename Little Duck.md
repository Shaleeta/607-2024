Found a text copy online of "The Tiger's Bride" and copied it into a doc. Formatted it and printed it so I can make notes, markup, etc. on it. Formatted it double space, 12 pt font with large paragraph breaks so it will be easy to read. Added page numbers so that I know at a glance if the pages are out of order.
Then, spent some time making the cover for the audiobook. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and since this isn't a design assignment, I'm not gonna worry about it anymore now that it's done.
I also bought these really cute headphones. They were only $40, and they aren't fantatic or anything. The reason I got them is because they have light up cat ears on them! I needed new headphones anyways, so this project gave me a good excuse to get these stupid things. I love them so much.

### Next Steps
Practice. Practice. Practice.
Keep a pencil in hand while I practice so that I can make notes on the script as I go.
Maybe find a second reader for different voices? I like the idea of having a male voice as well as a female one, but I'm not sure who I would ask. My dad might be into it. He's a good storyteller.
I'm hoping to start recording next week.

Ugggghhhh. I'm changing which story I'm going to read for my audiobook. I was going to do "The Tiger's Bride" but it's pretty long and I'd rather not do only part of it since it's already a short story. So, I'm going to look at "The Werewolf," also by Carter, or maybe I'll narrate one of my own short stories, which could be fun.

I've decided to do an audiobook version of one if my short stories since I think "The Werewolf" would be too short. Now I just need to decide which of my own stories I want to do.

I've been editing my short story, "The Woods" to get it ready to be read aloud. It's been a while since I've looked at it and I've definitely improved as a writer since I last read it. So, I'm doing some basic edits and then I'll format it into a script and mark it up to make it easier to read out. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'll play around with it and see.
We're talking in class about audio today and Audacity, which I downloaded onto my laptop yesterday. It's been ages since I've used it, so I'm looking forward to getting a primer on it.
I'm thinking I'm going to split up the story and record my audio in chunks so that I can retake certain sections if I need to and keep my files organized more easily. I've never really recorded audio (or anything) like this before so I'm quite nervous about getting started.
If things go well and I have time, I'd like to make my recording into a bit of an audio drama and put some sound effects in, and maybe find a male voice to read the male dialogue. All of the men that I know are pretty shy, though, and a lot of the men I know who are actors are also my exes... Weird. It's also a bit complicated because I'd need them to have the right audio equipment or be in Vancouver and willing to come over so they can use what I have. Maybe Spencer, my boyfriend, if he comes to visit at the end of the month would be willing. He's a closet theatre kid, but he doesn't have any acting experience that I know of.

My short story is edited. I put it into my PDF editor on my iPad and broke it up into sections so it's hopefully easier to read when I get there. I've been so busy trying to get this project done for Amanda that I haven't really had an opportunity to so much work on this yet. I'm hoping that the history project doesn't take me all weekend and that I have time to experiment with the audio equipment.
I'm surprisingly nervous about recording audio. I'm usually not a fan of hearing my own voice.

I finally got around to testing out my audio equipment today. I sat down in my closet after dinner and plugged it all in, then set about fiiguring out how to work it. It took me a bit because the Zoom has a hard time being an audio interface depending on how you plug it in. You have to make sure it's off when you plug it in. It'll turn on and then you have to select "Audio I/F" and then "Connect". It took some trial and error, but I got it to work.
I started testing with Audacity, but I didn't like using it. I was having a hard time with cutting out a section in the middle of my recording because it doesn't automatically cut out the empty space that results. It just leaves an empty space. So I switched to Adobe Audition and I like it better. I already have the Creative Cloud (which I hate, but what can you do?) so it wasn't really a thing to download it.
I'm still hoping to find a male voice actor to do the male part in the script, but I'm weirdly nervous about asking someone. Every time I try to get the men in my life to do any acting, they get weird. No one wants to play pretend with you after elementary school...
I've got the raw recording more or less done. It took me about three hours to troubleshoot everything and get twenty minutes of recording. The next time I sit down to do it, I'll start editing and retake any parts that I don't like my performance on. From everything I can tell, it isn't difficult to edit out mouth clicks and plosives, so I'll definitely do some of that. I'm curious what kinds of edits you can do with audio without it sounding unnatural or flat. There's definitely some fixes I'd like to do if I can figure out how.
I really like the Zoom but I find it finicky. Part way through my recording, it disconnected from my computer and wouldn't reconnect until I unplugged it and plugged it in again. I got it worked out, but all of these programs and tools and stuff freak me out, so for a solid second I thought I'd broken it. It also reset all of my input settings on the Zoom and on my computer, and I couldn't remember what input level I had on the Zoom so I had to trial-and-error it again. 
My only other complaint was that it was very hard to maintain a set distance from the microphone between takes. It took some fenagling to figure out a way of sitting and holding the mic that let me keep it at a uniform distance from my face.
I found the sweet spot for the audio input level on the Zoom was around 60, at least the second time I set it up.
I also found that, because the story I was reading had some moments of higher emotion (shouting, basically), I had to pull the mic away from my mouth at those points to keep from peaking the audio.
