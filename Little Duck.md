# H1 Audiobook Project - March 7th
## H2 Team Name: Little Duck

My team members are Moira.
I will be creating an audiobook version of the fairy tale "The Tiger's Bride" by Angela Carter. It's available for free on JSTOR.
The short story tells of a girl who's father wagered her hand in marriage to a tiger during a game of cards. I originally read it as part of a class on fairy tales during my undergrad. We read a few stories by Angela Carter, who has written several feminist retellings of classic folktales. Another favourite of mine by her is "The Werewolf." Both of these stories are from her anthology book, *The Bloody Chamber*.
