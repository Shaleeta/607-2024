# Creating a Download Page
It's time to present your audiobook to the world! Let's create a download page using CSS, Markdown, and HTML. I've created a sample page for you [here](DL.html). Download this html file and open it in your browser. You can find the original .md file I used [here](DL.md) and the CSS I used [here](CSS.css).

### Making Your Own
1. Write your page information in Markdown (using Sublime Text)
2. Using Pandoc, translate it to HTML
3. Write CSS (or edit this one as much as you'd like)
4. Add a cover image and a download button using HTML
5. Keep editing the CSS and HTML until you're happy with the download page (you can add background colour, columns, and more.)
