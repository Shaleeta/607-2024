## Documentation Principles
1. Have a Goal*
2. Be clear, concise, and accurate
3. Include as much detail as possible
4. Add visuals whenever you can
5. Use structure and organization (be consistent) 
7. Revise and reference previous comments**
8. Involve others whenever helpful
9. Make comments about your findings--you exist in this situation, what did you think? Not all data is quantifiable.
10. Include external sources to assist with explanations

I recommend writing your new documentation locally using Sublime Text (for the same reasons you wouldn't write a post in WordPress) but after uploading, you can make small edits directly in the program. Continue documenting the whole process in as much detail as possible. 

*There are two goals for this documentation process. First is to make your show-and-tell presentation much easier by having clear well-structured data to refer to. Second is to show your process and have that available for the next iteration of students in 607! What worked well? What should they avoid? What do you wish you spent more time on? Less? Documentation is a professional journal in some respects, and your experience here has value. 

**When making changes in GitHub you'll be asked to summarize changes before saving (*committing*) those changes. Consider using that feature for clear organization.
