## Documentation Principles
1. Be clear, concise, and accurate
2. Include as much detail as possible
3. Add visuals whenever you can
4. Use structure and organization
5. Be consistent
6. Revise and reference previous comments when possible
7. Involve others whenever helpful
8. Include external sources to assist explanations

I recommend writing your new documentation locally using Sublime Text (for the same reasons you wouldn't write a post in WordPress) but after uploading, you can make small edits directly in the program. Continue documenting the whole process in as much detail as possible.
