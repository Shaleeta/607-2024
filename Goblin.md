### Team: Goblin 

**Members:** Emily ðŸ˜ƒ

**Book:** *The Princess and the Goblin* by George MacDonald 

I am team **Goblin** I am going to be making an interactive audiobook for [The Princess and the Goblin](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/708/pg708-images.html) by George MacDonald. The tale follows a princess and a cast of goblins who hate poetry. 

For this project, I have hopes to make an interactive audiobook similar to Webtoons that has background music and voice acting while also being easy to follow as it is a children's fairy tale.

# Documentation Record

## Week 1 - March 7th

- [x] Create Repository 
- [x] Update Repository 
- [x] Write Introduction

Established page on the repository. I selected my book and determined what portion I would be recording. I need to format this into a script for reading so my brother can do the recording for it. I also downloaded Audacity as my recording software. 

I received my equipment as well. I'm hoping to do my recording over the weekend so that I can begin working on the background sounds and music. My plan for over the weekend is to complete my recording and start my audiobook cover. 

## Week 2 - March 12th

- [x] Begin Recording
- [x] Determine background music
- [x] Start Audiobook cover

I have started a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/emilymcgovern20/cover-ideas-audiobook/) for inspiration and old covers for this story to try and create something more engaging and perhaps more 80s fantasy-esque. I have also been looking at background music for my audiobook using royalty-free music.

### March 9th  
- Today I looked at royalty-free music and found a few playlists that I feel match the theme and emotion of the story I will be reading. I found some on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ac7KKFi3O1pnBzVPtj7SB) and on YouTube here.

I have started my audiobook cover. I've decided I want to stay true to the old aesthetic of The Princess and the Goblin. I'll be making my cover in Photoshop as it's what I'm most familiar with. 


### March 12th 

Today in class the focus was on audio and recording. I have mostly finished my audiobook cover for the time being but I will be sending it to Mauve to look over the fonts that I chose. For the fonts I found them on [Fontspace](https://www.fontspace.com/category/fantasy) and used "fantasy" as my prompt. 


### Cover
Here is my first rendition of my cover. 

Some notes on my cover design: 
- I wanted a cover that was clear to read
- The story is a children's fairy tale so I wanted it to follow that aesthetic
- While I wanted to have a goblin on the cover I found that the art in the style I desired was hard to find so I opted for fantasy art
- Many of the old covers for this book had an old fantasy aesthetic which can be found on my [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/emilymcgovern20/cover-ideas-audiobook/) I wanted to follow that style but making it slightly more modern and catchy. ðŸ˜¸

### March 13 - 14th 

I've finished my audiobook cover and switched to InDesign for the final format as opposed to Photoshop I found that my new Photoshop required me to update some graphics so for ease of creation I opted for InDesign instead. I am hoping to start recording this week after some revisions. 

For the audio, I'm thinking of having myself record the intro but having either my brother or my partner record the voices/story. I hope to start recording my own audio tonight. 

## Week 3 - March 19th 

Over the weekend I got around to recording my audio. I had a few errors in the initial steps so I ended up trying a different microphone. I recorded two different chapters (chp 1 and chp 8) with 5 min of audio each. In class, I focused on fixing up the audiobook cover and handed back my recording equipment. 

There are also some really funny bloopers in my recordings with my brother so I was thinking if I had time to put together a blooper reel.

For the next week, my goals are to:
- [x] Edit audio into two sections
- [x] Add sound effects
- [x] Record my audio portion (chapter titles)

I have recorded my chapter titles (in my closet) and added sound effects to my chapter 8 recording when needed. For the next week, my main focus is to put everything together into 2 final versions for chapter 1 and chapter 8 (each 5 min each). 


## Week 4 - March 26th 

I have edited all the audio clips and added the sound effects and background noises where needed. I have two samples. The first one is a typical 5-minute sample from Chapter 1 without sound effects so that I could learn how to create a standard audiobook. My second sample is a 5-minute clip from Chapter 8 that has voice acting, sound effects and background noise at certain parts. This was to see how I could incorporate these aspects into an audiobook. 

I thought of adding more sound effects and background music but I didn't want it to be too distracting. 

My next issue for this week is to focus on putting together the audiobook cover and audio.ðŸ“–ðŸŽµ


## Week 5 - April 2nd

The final step is making the download page which I think will be quite challenging I'm already confused by it but I'll figure it out. The download piece is proving challenging.

## Week 6 - April 9th 

This week is presentation week. I managed to fix my download issue by using Google Drive as opposed to .mp3 this worked very well and kept my files separate as I have 2 digital files. My download for html is finally working too! I had issues because I was downloading the file too many times and the download numbers were messing up my files. It is fixed now and I'm happy with the final result. 

I wanted to experiment more with css and customize my page more but I found that I didn't have enough time and it was hard to figure out. In the future I'd like to look more into how I could use CSS.
