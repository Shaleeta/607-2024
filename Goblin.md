### Team: Goblin 

Members: **Emily** ðŸ˜ƒ

Book: *The Princess and the Goblin* 

I am team Goblin I am going to be making an interactive audiobook for [The Princess and the Goblin](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/708/pg708-images.html) by George MacDonald. The tale follows a princess and a cast of goblins who hate poetry. 

For this project, I have hopes to make an interactive audiobook similar to Webtoons that have background music and voice acting while also being easy to follow as it is a children's fairy tale.

Established page on the repository. I selected my book and determined what portion I would be recording. I need to format this into a script for reading so my brother can do the recording for it. I also downloaded audacity as my recording software. 

## Week 2 -

- [ ] Determine background music
- [ ] Start Audiobook cover

I have started a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/emilymcgovern20/cover-ideas-audiobook/) for inspiration and old covers for this story to try and create something more engaging and perhaps more 80s fantasy esque.
