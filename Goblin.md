### Team: Goblin 

**Members:** Emily ðŸ˜ƒ

**Book:** *The Princess and the Goblin* by George MacDonald 

I am team **Goblin** I am going to be making an interactive audiobook for [The Princess and the Goblin](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/708/pg708-images.html) by George MacDonald. The tale follows a princess and a cast of goblins who hate poetry. 

For this project, I have hopes to make an interactive audiobook similar to Webtoons that have background music and voice acting while also being easy to follow as it is a children's fairy tale.

# Documentation Record

## Week 1 - March 7th

- [x] Create Repository 
- [x] Update Repository 
- [x] Write Introduction

Established page on the repository. I selected my book and determined what portion I would be recording. I need to format this into a script for reading so my brother can do the recording for it. I also downloaded Audacity as my recording software. 

I received my equipment as well. I'm hoping to do my recording over the weekend so that I can begin working on the background sounds and music. My plan for over the weekend is to complete my recording and start my audiobook cover. 

## Week 2 - March 12th

- [ ] Begin Recording
- [ ] Determine background music
- [x] Start Audiobook cover

I have started a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/emilymcgovern20/cover-ideas-audiobook/) for inspiration and old covers for this story to try and create something more engaging and perhaps more 80s fantasy-esque. I have also been looking at background music for my audiobook using royalty-free music.

### March 9th  
- Today I looked at royalty-free music and found a few playlists that I feel match the theme and emotion of the story I will be reading. I found some on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ac7KKFi3O1pnBzVPtj7SB) and on YouTube here.

I have started my audiobook cover. I've decided I want to stay true to the old aesthetic of The Princess and the Goblin. I'll be making my cover in Photoshop as it's what I'm most familiar with.
