# TBD (The Book Design) Podcast
## Kirstin & Rebecca 

### Introduction 
TBD Podcast are going to make a short five minute introductory podcast on the theme of book design and marketing. How do these two pieces work together? What makes a good book design and how does that influence a book marketing campaign? Kirstin and Rebecca will engage in a riveting dialogue over the course of five minutes to explore these concepts and more! Kirstin is an experienced marketer who almost always judges a book by its cover, Rebecca is a computer gremlin who has been creating for not long enough to run a podcast! The two will provide interesting perspectives on design, marketing and books. 

## Progress Report

### Week 1 - March 7th

- [x] Create Repository 
- [x] Write Introduction
- [x] Choose date(s) to record (March 23rd) 
- [x] Created [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wKqAWS8fh4DGoO0PELuPed_d3MSZxlmtmH4egvL7T3I/edit?usp=sharing) to track notes/progress

Established page on the repository. Selected theme and name for podcast as well as content ideas for the production.

**What Will the Podcast Include?**
For our first episode will include discussion of two recent releases. Kirstin and Rebecca will each select a title to judge by the cover! Our first episode will also include one *paid* advertisement by a yet to be decided bookstore!

### Week 2 - March 12th

- [x] Choose titles to review
- [x] Write intro script for podcast
- [x] Write ad script

This week we shifted our concept for the podcast slightly, still working with cover design critique and analysis, we are going to now take three new releases from a genre and compare and contrast the cover design for these titles. Some questions we may answer include:

<ul>
     <li>What are your initial thoughts/feelings?</li> 
      <li>What are the similarities with these covers? Are there overarching themes?</li>
      <li>What are the differences?</li>
      <li>Which cover is the most effective</li>
      <li>Which cover do you prefer?</li>
      <li>Would you read any of these books</li>
</ul>

The podcast outline will be as follows:
<ol>
      <li>Intro Song</li>
      <li>Introduction of Hosts</li>
      <li>Beginning of book cover discussions</li>
      <li>Ad</li>
      <li>Closing of book cover discussions</li>
</ol>

### Week 3 - March 19th
- [x] Trial Microphones and possible spaces for recording
- [x] Selecting Microphone and location for recording
- [x] Finish prepping script for recording on saturday

This week we began testing our equipment to prepare for recording on Saturday. We did not have an SD card so recorded directly onto our computer. The editing tool we will be using is Adobe Audition, we decided to use this interface because it is something that Rebecca has experience with. 

The locations we trialed were within Rebecca's small bachelor apartment using both the Zoom and the Shure microphone. Unfortunatley the The Shure microphone recorded with an ongoing buzz over all the audio. We think this may be due the cables and will troubleshoot this when we have more time by swapping out chords as well as trying a new Shure Microphone. 

The Zoom Mic recorded well and due to the buzz on the Shure mic, it actually sounded better. No sounds beyound the speakers voice were picked up, which was shocking as the living room was used to start. Rebecca lives across the street from a dog park and there are constantly dogs creating a ruckus, luckily this was not picked up with the mic. 

The other areas of the home used to trial the microphones were a small bed nook (the size of a double bed), and a bathroom. The bed nook created a great space for recording, it was quite with no outside sounds or echoes. The nook will be easily insulated as it is so small. The bathroom created and echo with the zoom mic but did an ok job with the Shure mic. The bed nook does seem to be the best option for recording our podcast, but we will have better information about this once we try a different microphone to get a sense of the sound without the overall buzz. 

For our recording session on Saturday we will play around with blocking the doorway with padded material. We will also need to put together a set up to hold our microphones in place. This is something we noted when trialing our microphones, as they move closer and further from the speaker it can create quite a different volume and effect. We will need to make sure we have a set up that keeps the microphones in place. 

### Recording Day: March 23

Today we recorded our podcast. 
Recording notes:
 
- Recording session held at Rebecca’s apartment, she set up a "recording studio" in her small bed nook. With a closet dampening sound on one side, we hung duvets on two of the other walls to create the booth. The bed added extra dampening.
- Set up the Zoom recorder to desktop computer, but there was a buzzing sound present when we recorded.
- Set up the other recorder using SD card, sound much better but it’s not in stereo. You can hear Kirstin in one ear and Rebecca in the other. We also heard sounds of hands on the microphone and Kirstin breathing while Rebecca talked (note to Kirstin: don’t hold the microphone so close when not talking).
- Rebecca figured out which setting needed to be on to make the sound record in stereo.
- We recorded the podcast in pieces, over the course of a couple hours. After listening to it playback we made a note of where we needed to re-record, things we needed to add, and places where we could delete content to tighten it up.
- Rebecca went in and pieced it all together and did a first round of edits. It’s currently just over 11 minutes long.

### Listening session: March 25

- Listened together and noted places to make small edits.
- Realized that our voices sound very similar! 
- Contemplating removing the ad to reduce the length.
- Identified some background and additional noises that would be dieally edited out (tapping the mic, breathing, etc). Tbd if these can be edited!
- Discussed creating an image to brand our podcast, and the need for a short write-up. 

### Editing: March 30/31

This weekend we edited our podcast. We prioritized getting the length down to about 10 minutes by removing long drawn out pauses and "uhms" (which Rebecca now knows the exact shape of an "uhm" sound wave!). This was successful! Once we cut down the length we worked on the actual sound. Some of the sound issues within the recording included rubbing the mic, breathing and inconsistant volume due to mic moving closer or further from our mouths. While volume issues are simple fixes, removing ongoing and overlapping sounds is quite difficult. We used the waveform to attempt to errase the rubbing sound and had varying success with this. Removing the loud breaths between words was also a simple task. 

### Notes For Presentation

Some of the pieces we should cover in our discussion:
- Creating a Podcast and needing content
- Recording set up, where we recorded, what we did to the space/why
- Originally tried to record directly into the computer with the newer/video zoom mic but this created a buzzing sound in the recordings, switched to the original zoom mic
- Originally recording into seperate ears, but wanting to record stereo/figuring that out
- Not being able to record on different channels (both microphones recorded into the same channel)
- Not breathing while speaking and gasping for air between sentances (possible examples)
- Mic scratching (possible examples), wave form and removal of scratching (image)
- "Ums" removing
- Air pops (possible examples)
- Inconsistent mic location (possible examples)
