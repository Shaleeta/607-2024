# More Dumb Computer Junk: In Hindsight

This was an excellent experience, and I am so happy with how it turned out. That said, there were some things I would change if I could. In no particular order:

- More in-class time testing equipment (ensuring Zoom recorders worked, playing with Audacity, etc.)
- An Audio studio on-campus would be amazing
- More discussion on why you don't just use general filters/tools to clean up audio/why you need to start clean
- If we're starting audio in week 2, ensure that week 4 includes 1-on-1 times with instructor to check in and see progress
- More on channels/ensure they get the difference between stereo and mono/how to use two channels
- See if Hannah will come in and share some tips/suggestions for recording (even for 30m or so), including:
    - Audible Production Standards
    - Tool to check in Audacity
    - Kitchen sponge on the mic
    - Sound floors
    - Pickups
    - Hindenberg program
- See about Chris Potter/Braedon Rangno coming in to give tips from an audio engineer?
- More CSS time! Play with that
