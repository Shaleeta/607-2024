Found a text copy online of "The Tiger's Bride" and copied it into a doc. Formatted it and printed it so I can make notes, markup, etc. on it. Formatted it double space, 12 pt font with large paragraph breaks so it will be easy to read. Added page numbers so that I know at a glance if the pages are out of order.
Then, spent some time making the cover for the audiobook. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, and since this isn't a design assignment, I'm not gonna worry about it anymore now that it's done.
I also bought these really cute headphones. They were only $40, and they aren't fantatic or anything. The reason I got them is because they have light up cat ears on them! I needed new headphones anyways, so this project gave me a good excuse to get these stupid things. I love them so much.

### Next Steps
Practice. Practice. Practice.
Keep a pencil in hand while I practice so that I can make notes on the script as I go.
Maybe find a second reader for different voices? I like the idea of having a male voice as well as a female one, but I'm not sure who I would ask. My dad might be into it. He's a good storyteller.
I'm hoping to start recording next week.

Ugggghhhh. I'm changing which story I'm going to read for my audiobook. I was going to do "The Tiger's Bride" but it's pretty long and I'd rather not do only part of it since it's already a short story. So, I'm going to look at "The Werewolf," also by Carter, or maybe I'll narrate one of my own short stories, which could be fun.

I've decided to do an audiobook version of one if my short stories since I think "The Werewolf" would be too short. Now I just need to decide which of my own stories I want to do.

I've been editing my short story, "The Woods" to get it ready to be read aloud. It's been a while since I've looked at it and I've definitely improved as a writer since I last read it. So, I'm doing some basic edits and then I'll format it into a script and mark it up to make it easier to read out. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'll play around with it and see.
We're talking in class about audio today and Audacity, which I downloaded onto my laptop yesterday. It's been ages since I've used it, so I'm looking forward to getting a primer on it.
I'm thinking I'm going to split up the story and record my audio in chunks so that I can retake certain sections if I need to and keep my files organized more easily. I've never really recorded audio (or anything) like this before so I'm quite nervous about getting started.
If things go well and I have time, I'd like to make my recording into a bit of an audio drama and put some sound effects in, and maybe find a male voice to read the male dialogue. All of the men that I know are pretty shy, though, and a lot of the men I know who are actors are also my exes... Weird. It's also a bit complicated because I'd need them to have the right audio equipment or be in Vancouver and willing to come over so they can use what I have. Maybe Spencer, my boyfriend, if he comes to visit at the end of the month would be willing. He's a closet theatre kid, but he doesn't have any acting experience that I know of.
