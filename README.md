Welcome to PUB 607, in which we will cover **Digital Production Fundamentals** for both EBooks and Audiobooks, in just six short weeks! This course is based on John's *decades* of experimentation with digital production, which have been distilled here into a set of best practices. 

This course presents both *theory* and *practice* so that you may come to an understanding of *why* production should be done this way. The fundamental learning approach in PUB 607 is working with simple technologies and playing with production techniques to become comfortable and confident with technology as a whole.
